Submitted for UCD project


This project scrapes data from FBRef and Football-Data to compile a dataframe of FBRef's metrics, as well as each team's average win probability (derived from average odds).
It then allows the user to conduct a K-Means analysis to cluster teams based on either pre-set or bespoke Features.
Following this, it produces a graph with a subplot to show each team's xG and goals totals as well as ordered average win probability.
